## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge was to build a tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to build a functional tip calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I practiced working with form inputs, implementing calculations based on user input, and displaying the results dynamically. Additionally, I gained experience in creating responsive layouts and handling edge cases in user input validation.

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to continue enhancing my skills in JavaScript, focusing on improving code organization, modularization, and error handling. I also aim to explore more advanced JavaScript concepts like asynchronous programming and working with APIs. Additionally, I will continue to improve my responsive web design skills and accessibility practices.
